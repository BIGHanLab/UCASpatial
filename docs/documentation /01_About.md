Here, we introduce an ultra-resolution ST deconvolution algorithm (UCASpatial) that improves the resolution of mapping cell subpopulations to spatial locations by leveraging the contribution of genes indicative of cell identity through entropy-based weighting. Using both in silico and real ST datasets, we demonstrate that UCASpatial improves the robustness and accuracy in identifying low-abundant cell subpopulations and distinguishing transcriptionally heterogeneous cell subpopulations.
